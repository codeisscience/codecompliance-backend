After cloning this repo, you can use
[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) to create the virtual
environment (virtualenv) and install the dependencies on it.

First, spawn a shell with the virtualenv activated (you can use `exit`/Ctrl+D
to leave the shell/virtualenv):

```console
$ poetry shell
```

> Then, install the dependencies:

```console
$ poetry install
```

> version:

```console
$ flask --version
```
